# Old Website in React

This was my old website written in React with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. It was a fun project to work on and I learned a lot about React and Tailwind CSS. I have since moved on to a new website written in Astro. You can find the source code for that website [here](https://github.com/a2ys/website).

This code will be archived and no longer maintained. Feel free to use it as a reference or for your own projects. This project was built with [Create Vite App](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html).

## Running the Project

To run the project, first clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a2ys/old-website-react.git
cd old-website-react
npm install
```

Then, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the compiled files. You can then deploy this folder to your web server.
